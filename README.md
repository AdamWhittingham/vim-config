Ad's Neovim Config
==================

A potent Neovim config, enhanced with rich flavours of software development and notable hints of Ruby, JS and Go.

# Installation

```bash
git clone -b nvim https://github.com/AdamWhittingham/vim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### Still using Vim? (rather than Neovim)
If you haven't moved to Neovim, I've left the `master` branch in-tact with the now unmaintained Vim-centric config on to avoid breaking anything.
I'd urge you to consider switching to Neovim and trying the new stuff out, it's fantastic!

# Optional external dependencies
There's a couple of tools that make this config really work well:

1. Running in [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) with a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) because we deserve pretty things in the terminal.
2. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) makes a lot of searches **much** faster
3. [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) Similarly, `fd` is a replacement to find which makes file listing much faster

# First Time Setup
Neovim is incredibly powerful but can do even more when it has some awareness of the languages you are editing.
To provide Neovim with this context, we need to install some Language Servers. Thankfully this can all be done for us:

- Install a language servers the language of the file you have open with `:Mason` and pressing `i` on Language Servers you want

# Key Mappings
For the canonical list, see [keymaps.lua](./lua/config/keymaps.lua)
You can also type `:WhichKey` for a helpful list, or pausing in the middle of a sequence will show you the options to complete it.

The `<leader>` key is **Space**.
This is referred to as `<leader>` so that it's easier to read, and will still make sense if you change to a different leader key.

# Goals and Guides

This project has two goals:
1. Empower me to get more done in my daily work as an engineer.
2. Be an easy starting point for learning Vim. Occasionally, someone I work with wants to learn Vim, so I want this to be useful and slightly familiar starting point until they are ready to build their own config.

It's easy to get carried away with every plugin, key binding and option that you see online, so I use the following guiding principles:

1. Plugins aren't inherently evil. I respect people who go the full vim-minimalism route and only use it as it comes out of the box, but it is a tool for a purpose. Anything that give me more context and lets me focus more on the work at hand is a good thing.
2. Too many plugins are evil. If installation becomes complex, or performance takes a dive, things need to go. Everything has a cost and needs to earn it's keep.
3. Additional key mappings should be consistent and ideally use a mnemonic. For example, `c` is used for version control and diff functions, using the mnemonic "Change" (e.g. add changes, reset changes).
