Ad's Neovim Config
==================

A potent Neovim config, enhanced with rich flavours of software development and notable hints of Ruby, JS and Go.

# Installation

```bash
git clone -b nvim https://github.com/AdamWhittingham/vim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### Still using Vim?
If you haven't moved to Neovim, I've left the `master` branch in-tact with it on.

# Optional external dependencies
There's a couple of tools that make this config really work well:

1. Running in [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) with a [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) because we deserve pretty things in the terminal.
2. [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) makes a lot of searches **much** faster
3. [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) Similarly, `fd` is a replacement to find which makes file listing much faster

# Key Mappings
For the canonical list, see [keymaps.lua](./lua/config/keymaps.lua)
You can also type `:WhichKey` for a helpful list, or pausing in the middle of a sequence will show you the options to complete it.

The `<leader>` key is **Space**

# Goals and Guides

This project has two goals:
1. Empower me to get more done in my daily work as an engineer.
2. Be easy to started with, so when someone I work with wants to learn Vim, they can use this as a starting point until they are ready to build their own config.

It's easy to get carried away with every plugin, keybind and option that you see online, so I use the following guiding principles:

1. Plugins aren't evil. I respect people who go the full vim-minimalism route and only use it as it comes out of the box, but it is a tool for a purpose. Anything that give me more context and lets me focus more on the work at hand is a good thing.
2. Too many plugins are evil. If installation becomes complex, or performance takes a dive, things need to go. Everything has a cost and needs to earn it's keep.
3. Additional key mappings should be consistent and ideally use a mnemonic. For example, `c` is used for git hunks using the mnemonic "Change" (e.g. add changes, reset changes).
